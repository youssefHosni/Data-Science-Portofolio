## [Masters thesis: Respiratory modulation of cardiovascular brain pulsations in Alzheimer’s disease](https://github.com/youssefHosni/Respiratory-modulation-of-cardiovascular-pulsation)

* Utilized statistical methods to find the significant differences in the modulation of brain cardiovascular pulse with respiration between controls and Alzheimer’s cases to help the neurological researchers to have a better understanding of Alzheimer’s diseases. The differences found were strongly significant (P<0.01) and novel.  
* Preprocessed and extracted features using a 3D multiresolution optical flow of 0.25 TB complex brain imaging data using python.
* Publication: __Youssef Hosni__, Ahmed Elabasy et.al., Respiration modulates cardiovascular brain impulse pathology in Alzheimer’s disease. Submitted to Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism.  
* Publication: Ahmed Elabasy, __Youssef Hosni__ et.al., Optical Flow Analysis of Propagating Respiratory Brain Pulsations. Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging.
