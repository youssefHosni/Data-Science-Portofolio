# Sensor Activity Recogniation 


### Dataset
The dataset can be downloaded __[here](https://www.kaggle.com/youssef19/sensor-activity-dataset)__

The feature matrix has 381 columns and n of rows depending on the widnow size 

The first column is the labels column , so after that there are 380 columns which is the following :
380= 9*5*8

9:(3 axis for the three sensors: Accelometer , Linear Accelometer  and Gyroscope)

5:(five positions and they are in this order: left pocket,right pocket,belt,wrist,upper arm  )

3:(eight features an dthey are in these order:

     1.Mean

     2.Standard Deviation 

     3.Median 

     4.Variance 

     5.Zero crossings

     6.Root mean square value 

     7.Sum of FFT coefficients

     8.Signal energy medium )


So the first 8 columns are the features of the xasis of the accelometer for the left pocket position and so on .
